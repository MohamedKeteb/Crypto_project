    "\n",
    "- **Auto-Regressive model (AR)** parametized by a value p, which allows to predict the future value of a time series through a regression on its last p values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Moving Average model (MA)** parametized by a value q, which instead of using past forecast values uses past forecast errors in a regression-like model and aim to improve the model's forecasts by knowing how far off our prediction from yesterday was compared to the actual value. The forcasts are made based on the last q periods before the current period.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**ARIMA** model have a last parameter, the order of differenciation d, which is the number of times we must differenciate the time series to make it stationnary. **Stationnary is a must-have feature** in our time series that allows us to apply the two components (AR, MA) of the ARIMA model.\n",
